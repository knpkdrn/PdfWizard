# SplitPDF - PdfWizard

## Introduction
Welcome to the SplitPDF tool, a part of the PdfWizard project. This tool is specifically designed for cutting pages out of PDF files into separate files.

## Motivation
I developed SplitPDF out of a personal need for my studies. I often found myself dealing with large PDF documents, where I only needed a few specific pages or sections. I did not find an existing free tool that could help me fast, so I started working on a solution. SplitPDF is the result of this effort. It's tailored to offer a simple yet effective way to extract content from PDF files, making the process more efficient for me.

## Current Status
It's important to note that SplitPDF is currently a work in progress. While it is functional, there are still several features and improvements I am planning to implement. I'm not actively working on it, but when I have the time I will try to make it more robust and feature-rich. 

## Contributing
I welcome contributions to this project! If you have suggestions, bug reports, or would like to contribute code, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

Thank you for visiting my project. I hope it helps you as much as it has helped me in my studies!
